# UK Road Accidents Dashboard in Tableau

This repository contains a Tableau dashboard designed to analyze and visualize UK road accident data. The dashboard allows users to explore key metrics related to accidents, casualties, and contributing factors like weather conditions, road types, and vehicle types. It is a single-page interactive dashboard designed to provide insights into road safety and accident trends.

## Project Overview

The UK Road Accidents Dashboard provides a comprehensive view of road accidents and their impact on casualties. Users can explore various metrics like the total number of accidents, fatalities, and casualties based on different factors. The dashboard also visualizes data geographically, offering insights into accident-prone areas.

### Key Features:
- A single-page dashboard with interactive visualizations.
- Metrics include total accidents, total casualties, fatalities, serious casualties, and slight casualties.
- Detailed insights on fatalities by road type, casualties by weather conditions, road surface, and vehicle type.
- Demographic analysis of casualties through a map, providing geographic and demographic insights.

## Dashboard Highlights

The UK Road Accidents Tableau dashboard provides an insightful overview of key road safety metrics, allowing users to interact with and analyze UK road accident data. The dashboard is a single-page interactive view that includes various visualizations, each focusing on different aspects of road accidents and casualties. 

Key visualizations include:

- **Accident Overview**: Displays metrics like total accidents, total casualties, and the breakdown of fatalities and injuries across different severity levels.
- **Contributing Factors**: Visualizations show how weather conditions, road surface, and road types contribute to accidents and casualties.
- **Casualty Insights**: Detailed insights into casualties, including their demographic distribution and vehicle types involved in accidents.
- **Geographic Analysis**: A map-based visualization helps identify accident-prone areas and visualize casualty data by geographic location.

These visualizations together allow for a comprehensive exploration of road accident trends, helping users understand the impact of various factors on road safety in the UK.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites:
- **Tableau Desktop** to open and interact with the Tableau workbook.
- **Accident Dataset**: Dataset containing road accident details in the UK (provided in the repository).

### Steps to Run:
1. **Clone or Download the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HarshaEadara/UK-Road-Accidents-Dashboard-in-Tableau.git
   ```
2. **Open Tableau**: Launch Tableau Desktop.
3. **Load the Dashboard**:
   - Go to `File > Open` in Tableau and select the `.twb` or `.twbx` file provided in the repository.
4. **Explore the Dashboard**:
   - Interact with the visualizations and use the filters to analyze accident data by various factors such as weather, road type, and vehicle type.

### File Structure:
- `Data`: Contains the link to download the dataset containing data about UK road accidents (From Kaggle).
- `UK_Road_Accidents_Dashboard.twbx`: Tableau workbook with the interactive dashboard..

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project is from Kaggle and contains detailed information about road accidents in the UK, including accident locations, severity, contributing factors, and casualties. The dataset can be downloaded from the following link:

The dataset includes:
- **Accident Information**: Data on the location, date, and time of accidents, as well as their severity.
- **Casualty Information**: Data on casualties, including the type of injury (fatal, serious, slight).
- **Contributing Factors**: Weather conditions, road types, and other contributing factors such as road surface conditions and vehicle types.
- **Geospatial Data**: Geographic coordinates for accident locations to provide a map-based view of casualty distribution.

## Visualizations

The dashboard includes the following visualizations:

- **Total Accidents**: Displays the overall number of accidents in the dataset.
- **Total Casualties**: Shows the total number of casualties resulting from accidents.
- **Fatal Casualties**: Visualizes the number of fatalities in accidents.
- **Serious Casualties**: Displays the number of serious injuries in accidents.
- **Slight Casualties**: Shows the number of slight injuries resulting from accidents.
- **Fatal Casualties by Road Type**: A breakdown of fatalities by different road types (e.g., motorways, single carriageways).
- **Casualties by Weather**: Visualizes casualties categorized by weather conditions at the time of the accidents.
- **Casualties by Road Surface**: Displays casualties based on road surface conditions (e.g., dry, wet, icy).
- **Casualties by Vehicle Type**: Shows how casualties are distributed across different types of vehicles (e.g., cars, trucks, motorcycles).
- **Casualties by Demographics**: An interactive map that visualizes casualties based on demographic factors like age, gender, and other relevant metrics.

## Usage

This dashboard enables users to:
- **Analyze Trends**: Understand accident and casualty trends across the UK.
- **Explore Contributing Factors**: Investigate how factors like weather, road surface, and vehicle type contribute to accidents and casualties.
- **Identify Accident-Prone Areas**: Use the map-based visualizations to identify areas with high accident rates and analyze casualty distributions.
